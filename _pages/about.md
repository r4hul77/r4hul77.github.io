In the heart of Hyderabad, India, my early life was a kaleidoscope of vibrant experiences. Yet, destiny whisked me across oceans to the United States, with dreams of mastering mechanical engineering. This ambition, however, was merely the prelude to a deeper passion I discovered: Robotics. The magic of animating the physical world through digital commands captivated me, driving me into the arms of controls, modeling, and simulation at Cleveland State University's CRM Lab.

My quest didn't halt there. From the energy of startups to Caterpillar's might, my path was rich with learning. It was amidst the semi-controlled chaos of agriculture that I found my true purpose, spotting a crucial void in robotics. Driven to bridge this gap, I embarked on a PhD journey in Biology and Agricultural Engineering at Kansas State University, with the Farms Lab serving as my arena to unravel agriculture's complexities.

Away from the rigor of research and innovation, I'm a soul fueled by literature, photography, and culinary adventures. My odyssey from Hyderabad's embrace to America's vast landscapes embodies my unyielding zeal for exploration and enlightenment.
