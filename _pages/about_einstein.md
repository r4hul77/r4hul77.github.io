Growing up in the bustling city of Hyderabad, India, my world was a vibrant tapestry of colors, smells, and sounds. Little did I know that my journey would take me thousands of miles away to the United States, all in pursuit of a dream. That dream? A master’s degree in mechanical engineering. But as fate would have it, that was just the beginning.

It was during my studies that I stumbled upon my true passion: Robotics. The idea that I could bridge the digital with the physical world, transforming lines of code into tangible actions, was nothing short of magic to me. My curiosity became an obsession, leading me to dive headfirst into the realms of controls, modeling, and simulation. The [CRM Lab](https://academic.csuohio.edu/richter-hanz/) at Cleveland State University became my new home, where I was introduced to the enchanting world of Controls and Modeling.

My journey didn’t stop there. From working at dynamic startups to the powerhouse that is Caterpillar, I gathered a wealth of experience. Yet, it was in the fields of semi-controlled agriculture that I found my calling. I realized a glaring gap in the robotics space – a gap I was determined to fill. This realization propelled me towards a PhD in Biology and Agricultural Engineering at Kansas State University, where the [Farms Lab](https://farmslab.k-state.edu/) offered me a playground to explore the intricacies of agriculture and its unique challenges.

Outside the lab and beyond the blueprints of my next project, I am a different person. You might find me lost in the pages of a book, behind the lens of my camera capturing life’s unscripted moments, or in the kitchen, experimenting with flavors from around the globe. My journey from Hyderabad to the heartland of America is a testament to the power of passion, curiosity, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.
